//Javascript is primarily a prototype-based language and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.In other words it provides more familiar syntax for developers cmoing from class-based languages such as C++, but under the hood, it works somewhat differently.

//javascript and classes 
//oops

//object

// -collection of properties and methods
//-toLowerCase

//why use OOP

//parts of OOP
// Object literal

// -Constructor function
// -Prototypes
// -Classes
// -Instances (new,this)



//In javascript everything is an object, and the properties that are available to objects, those properties are available to strings and arrays as well. Whether those are usable or not that is a different thing, but those are inherited from the grandparent. This is not only in case of arrays or strings, this is for all.
